##Data Structures Code Challenge
This project contains a simple Python function defined within a Jupyter Notebook for a basic "code challenge."

###Project Overview
The primary purpose of the vehicle_type function is to simply return the input string that is passed to it. It serves as a foundational example, potentially for testing environment setup or a basic data-passing exercise.

###File Contents
Data_structures_code_challenge.ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code and test executions.

The vehicle_type Function
The function is defined as follows:

'''Python

def vehicle_type(input):
    vehicle_type = input
    return vehicle_type
    '''
How it works: The function takes a single string argument (input) and immediately assigns it to a variable named vehicle_type, which is then returned.

###How to Run the Code
To execute the code in the notebook, you will need a Python environment with Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed.

Dependencies: Ensure you have Python and Jupyter installed.

Open the Notebook: Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and open the file Data_structures_code_challenge.ipynb.

Execute Cells: Run the code cells sequentially to see the function definition and the example test cases:

'vehicle_type("tractor")'

'vehicle_type("car")'

'vehicle_type("harvester")'
